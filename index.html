                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>William Shakespeare (baptized 26 April 1564 ~ 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. 
                  Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, and sometimes referred to as "The Bard", his works, include 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three narrative poems. (There are other works that may be his, but the debate rages on.) His works are performed more often than those of any other playwright
                  and he still reaches audiences today due to his unbelievable understanding of human nature and undeniable wit. ~ Wikipedia and myself combined
