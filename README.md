*Welcome to the Shakespearean Translator. Have you ever wondered what you would have sounded like back in Olde Elizabethan England? Have you longed to sound like a poet? Well now you can. Simply enter your text, click translate and wait with bated breath. It's that simple. Now if you are feeling particularly bawdy, click on the image of Master Shakespeare and see what happens. <br>"If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended", twas all in good jest.*

## Overview
My first coding project. I am using an open API and two of their endpoints.
This project is vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.




## Features
A collapsible dropdown menu on the navigation bar with directions, information about Shakespeare and sources. An input textarea, for the words being translated and a translate button when clicked returns the translation. There is also an hidden(sort of) easter egg, in that the Shakespeare image is a button that when clicked a modal will pop up and randomly insult you. This is done with Math.floor(Math.random()* array.length) array[index]


----
## How to use
1. Insert the text you want translated
2. Click the translate button
3. Translation will be returned
4. Click on the Shakespeare image
5. And a random insult will appear
6. Click dismiss and the insult will disappear
7. If you have typed in very long text, 
use the forward arrow to scroll through the translation.

>**Information**
> * William Shakespeare (baptized 26 April 1564 ~ 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. 
Born in Stratford-upon-Avon, and sometimes referred to as "The Bard", his works, include 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three narrative poems. (There are other works that may be his, but the debate rages on.) His works are performed more often than those of any other playwright
and he still reaches audiences today due to his unbelievable understanding of human nature and undeniable wit. ~ Wikipedia and myself combined
> * Background Image is an inset from the etching, Long View of London from Bankside, by Wenceslaus Hollar, 1647.
> * The Image of Shakespeare is from The Chandos portrait, held by the National Portrait Gallery, in London. Attributed to John Taylor, it is the most famous of the portraits that are believed to depict William Shakespeare (1564â€“1616). 
But nobody knows for sure, if it is indeed him.
